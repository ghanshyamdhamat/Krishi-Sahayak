# An Exhaustive Technical Report on Paddy Crop Cultivation in Tamil Nadu: A Synthesis of the TNAU Agritech Portal

chunksize 1
section: Introduction
subsection: null
Rice (*Oryza sativa* L.) stands as one of the three most important food
crops globally, serving as the primary staple for over 2.7 billion
people.^1^ In India, the cultivation of rice is a cornerstone of the
agricultural economy and national food security. The nation dedicates
approximately 44.6 million hectares to rice cultivation, yielding a
total output of 80 million tonnes of paddy with an average productivity
of 1855 kg/ha.^1^ This extensive cultivation spans nearly all states,
with West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu
being among the major producers, collectively contributing to 92% of the
total area and production.^1^

Tamil Nadu, in particular, has a deeply entrenched history of paddy
cultivation, supported by a diverse range of agro-climatic conditions
and a sophisticated, traditional agricultural calendar. Recognizing the
critical importance of this crop, the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University
(TNAU), a premier institution for agricultural research and extension,
has developed a comprehensive \"Expert System for Paddy.\" This system
serves as an authoritative repository of scientific knowledge, best
practices, and technological innovations tailored for the state\'s
unique agricultural landscape. This report provides a comprehensive synthesis of the information
contained within the TNAU Agritech Portal\'s Expert System for Paddy.

section: Section 1: Botanical Profile and Agro-Climatic Requirements
subsection: null
A foundational understanding of the paddy plant\'s biology and its
interaction with the environment is essential for successful
cultivation. The TNAU portal provides a detailed account of the
botanical classification, morphology, and the specific agro-climatic
parameters necessary for optimal growth and yield.

chunksize 4
section: Section 1: Botanical Profile and Agro-Climatic Requirements
subsection: 1.1 Botanical Classification and Morphology of ***Oryza sativa*** {#botanical-classification-and-morphology-of-oryza-sativa}
The paddy plant is systematically classified within the plant kingdom as
follows ^2^:

- **Kingdom:** Plantae

- **Division:** Magnoliophyta

- **Class:** Liliopsida

- **Order:** Cyperales

- **Family:** Gramineae (or Poaceae)

- **Genus:** *Oryza*

- **Species:** *sativa*

- **Subspecies:** *indica*

The morphology of the rice plant is characterized by distinct vegetative
and reproductive structures that govern its growth and productivity. - **Roots:** The plant develops an adventitious root system from the
  > basal nodes. Root development is promoted by the application of
  > organic and phosphatic manures, with clayey soils providing an ideal
  > medium for their growth.^2^

- **Culm (Stem):** The culm is a jointed stem composed of a series of
  > nodes and internodes.^2^

- **Leaves:** Leaves are borne alternately on the culm in opposite
  > directions, with one leaf produced at each node. The leaf consists
  > of the leaf sheath, which is wrapped around the culm, and the leaf
  > blade. A circular collar joins these two parts.

chunksize 5
section: Section 1: Botanical Profile and Agro-Climatic Requirements
subsection: 1.1 Botanical Classification and Morphology of ***Oryza sativa*** {#botanical-classification-and-morphology-of-oryza-sativa}
The leaf consists
  > of the leaf sheath, which is wrapped around the culm, and the leaf
  > blade. A circular collar joins these two parts. Key appendages
  > include the **ligule**, a papery membrane at the juncture of the
  > sheath and blade, and the **auricles**, which are small, paired,
  > ear-like structures at the base of the blade.^2^

- **Flag Leaf:** The topmost leaf situated just below the panicle is
  > known as the flag leaf. This leaf is of paramount physiological
  > importance as it is the primary source of photosynthetic products
  > that are translocated to the developing grains. Its health and
  > efficiency during the grain-filling stage are, therefore, direct
  > determinants of final yield.^2^

- **Panicle:** The panicle is the terminal shoot of the rice plant,
  > which bears the grains. It consists of units called spikelets.^3^

- **Grain (Caryopsis):** The rice grain is a true fruit, technically a
  > caryopsis, where the seed coat is fused with the ovary wall. It
  > consists of the hull (palea and lemma) and the brown rice, which
  > contains the embryo and the endosperm. The endosperm serves as the
  > food source for the germinating embryo.^2^

chunksize 6
section: Section 1: Botanical Profile and Agro-Climatic Requirements
subsection: 1.2 Climatic Parameters for Optimal Growth {#climatic-parameters-for-optimal-growth}
Rice is fundamentally a crop of tropical and sub-tropical climates,
requiring specific environmental conditions for its various growth
phases.^2^

- **Temperature:** Paddy requires a fairly high temperature, with a
  > general range of 20°C to 40°C. The optimal temperature for overall
  > development is considered to be 30°C during the daytime and 20°C at
  > night.^2^ Different growth stages have specific optimal temperature
  > ranges ^2^:

  - **Germination:** 20-35°C

  - **Seedling Emergence:** 25-30°C

  - **Rooting:** 25-28°C

  - **Tillering:** 25-31°C

  - Leaf Elongation: 31°C  
    > High temperatures during the ripening phase can accelerate grain
    > maturation, leading to prematurity and the formation of chalky
    > kernels, while low temperatures can prolong the growth duration.3

- **Rainfall and Water:** The crop demands abundant water, with an
  > annual rainfall requirement ranging from 150 cm to 200 cm. It is
  > cultivated as both a lowland crop with standing water and an upland
  > rainfed crop. A rainfall of at least 125 cm is required during its
  > vegetative stage.

chunksize 7
section: Section 1: Botanical Profile and Agro-Climatic Requirements
subsection: 1.2 Climatic Parameters for Optimal Growth {#climatic-parameters-for-optimal-growth}
It is
  > cultivated as both a lowland crop with standing water and an upland
  > rainfed crop. A rainfall of at least 125 cm is required during its
  > vegetative stage. However, the timing of rainfall is critical; heavy
  > downpours during anthesis (flowering) can wash away pollen and lead
  > to sterility, significantly reducing grain set.^2^

- **Relative Humidity (RH):** Relative humidity directly influences the
  > plant\'s water relations and indirectly affects growth,
  > photosynthesis, and pollination. High humidity conditions are
  > conducive to the incidence of many insect pests and fungal diseases. > For instance, high RH favors the germination of fungal spores, such
  > as those causing blast disease, on plant leaves. Pests like the
  > Brown Plant Hopper thrive under conditions of moderate rainfall,
  > high RH (around 80%), and temperatures between 20-33°C.^2^

The intricate relationship between the plant\'s morphology and these
climatic factors is evident. The efficiency of the flag leaf in grain
filling is directly dependent on optimal solar radiation and
temperature. Any deviation, such as excessive cloud cover or extreme
temperatures, can impair this critical physiological process. This
establishes a clear link between managing the agro-climatic environment
and achieving high productivity.

temperature. Any deviation, such as excessive cloud cover or extreme
temperatures, can impair this critical physiological process. This
establishes a clear link between managing the agro-climatic environment
and achieving high productivity. Furthermore, the influence of humidity
on pest and disease proliferation demonstrates that climatic management
is inseparable from crop protection, creating a web of interconnected
agronomic challenges.

chunksize 9
section: Section 1: Botanical Profile and Agro-Climatic Requirements
subsection: 1.3 Soil Requirements and Suitability {#soil-requirements-and-suitability}
Rice exhibits remarkable adaptability, allowing it to be cultivated in
almost all types of soils, from the Indo-Gangetic plains to the coastal
deltas, provided that high temperature, high humidity, and sufficient
irrigation facilities are available.^2^ In India, rice is grown across a
wide range of soil groups, including riverine alluvium, red-yellow
soils, red loamy soils, laterite, coastal alluvium, and various black
soils.^2^ This adaptability allows for its cultivation from sea level up
to an elevation of 3000 meters and across latitudes from 8°N to 35°N.^2^

chunksize 10
section: Section 2: Paddy Cultivation Seasons and Varieties in Tamil Nadu
subsection: null
The agricultural practices for paddy in Tamil Nadu are governed by a
highly developed and localized cultivation calendar. This system,
refined over centuries, divides the year into distinct seasons, each
with specific timings, durations, and suitable crop varieties. This
intricate scheduling is a sophisticated adaptation to the state\'s
diverse agro-climatic zones and its reliance on the bimodal rainfall
pattern of the South-West and North-East monsoons.

chunksize 11
section: Section 2: Paddy Cultivation Seasons and Varieties in Tamil Nadu
subsection: 2.1 Classification of Planting Seasons {#classification-of-planting-seasons}
There are eight principal paddy planting seasons recognized in Tamil
Nadu, each tailored to specific regional weather patterns and water
availability.^5^ The distinction between short-duration varieties for
seasons like

*Kuruvai* and medium-to-long duration varieties for the main *Samba*
season reflects a deliberate strategy to align the crop\'s life cycle
with the expected duration of water supply, thereby mitigating the risks
associated with unpredictable monsoons. The details of these seasons are
summarized in Table 1.

The geographical clustering of these seasons highlights their alignment
with regional climatic nuances. For instance, the *Kuruvai* season is
predominantly practiced in the Cauvery delta districts (Thanjavur,
Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam), which historically rely on the release of
water from the Mettur Dam in June. The *Kar* season is concentrated in
the southern districts, which receive early showers from the South-West
monsoon. This finely tuned system, while efficient, is also vulnerable. Any disruption, such as a delayed monsoon or a failure in dam water
release, can have cascading negative impacts on the regional paddy
economy, forcing farmers into suboptimal choices regarding planting time
and variety duration.

Paddy cultivation in Tamil Nadu is practiced across three principal
ecosystems, each defined by its water management regime: the Wet system,
the Dry system, and the Semidry system.^6^ The Wet system, also known as
irrigated rice, is the most dominant, contributing to 55% of the
state\'s total rice production.^6^ Within this system, the Tamil Nadu
Agricultural University has placed significant emphasis on promoting the
System of Rice Intensification (SRI) as a water-efficient and
high-productivity alternative to conventional methods.

chunksize 15
section: Section 3: Principal Rice Ecosystems and Cultivation Methodologies
subsection: 3.1 Detailed Analysis of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) {#detailed-analysis-of-the-system-of-rice-intensification-sri}
SRI is not a fixed package of practices but a methodology based on a set
of principles that alter the management of plants, soil, water, and
nutrients to foster healthier and more extensive root systems, leading
to more productive plants.^6^ This institutional focus on SRI represents
a strategic response to the growing challenges of water scarcity and the
need to enhance productivity without expanding cultivated area. #### 3.1.1 Core Principles and Critical Steps of SRI {#core-principles-and-critical-steps-of-sri}

The successful implementation of SRI hinges on adherence to several
critical steps that collectively create a more favorable growing
environment for the rice plant ^6^:

1. **Reduced Seed Rate and Nursery Area:** SRI requires only 7-8 kg of
    > seed per hectare, a drastic reduction from conventional rates. > Consequently, the nursery area is reduced to just 100 m² per
    > hectare.^6^

2. **Transplanting Young Seedlings:** Very young seedlings, typically
    > 14 days old (at the 3-leaf stage), are transplanted. This
    > preserves the plant\'s potential for high tillering and root
    > growth.^6^

3. **Single Seedling and Wide Spacing:** A single seedling is carefully
    > planted per hill to avoid root competition and trauma.

This
    > preserves the plant\'s potential for high tillering and root
    > growth.^6^

3. **Single Seedling and Wide Spacing:** A single seedling is carefully
    > planted per hill to avoid root competition and trauma. The
    > seedlings are planted in a square pattern, typically at a wide
    > spacing of 25 cm x 25 cm, which provides ample space for each
    > plant to grow and tiller profusely.^6^

4. **Mechanical Weeding:** The square planting geometry facilitates the
    > use of a mechanical weeder, such as a cono weeder, in two
    > directions (north-south and east-west). This not only controls
    > weeds but also aerates the topsoil, which improves root health and
    > incorporates weeds as organic matter. Weeding is recommended at
    > 10-day intervals starting from 10 days after transplanting
    > (DAT).^6^

5. **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) Water Management:** This is a
    > cornerstone of SRI. Instead of continuous flooding, the field is
    > irrigated to moisten the soil, and then water is allowed to recede
    > until hairline cracks appear before the next irrigation.

The data clearly shows that despite slightly higher transplanting costs
due to the need for skilled labor, the overall expenditure for SRI is
lower, driven by massive savings in seed and nursery costs. Coupled with
a significantly higher grain yield, this results in a net profit that is
more than double that of the conventional method and a substantially
higher cost-benefit ratio.^6^

Beyond profitability, SRI offers a host of agronomic and environmental
advantages ^6^:

- **Increased Tillering:** Plants can easily produce 30 or more tillers. - **Profuse Root Growth:** The aerobic soil conditions lead to larger,
  > deeper root systems. - **Improved Grain Filling:** Larger panicles with higher grain weight
  > are common. - **Reduced Lodging:** Stronger culms and extensive roots make plants
  > more resistant to lodging. - **Lower Pest and Disease Incidence:** Healthier plants are often more
  > resilient. #### 3.1.4 Constraints to SRI Adoption {#constraints-to-sri-adoption}

Despite its clear benefits, the large-scale adoption of SRI faces
several practical challenges on the ground ^6^:

- **Strict Water Control:** Requires reliable irrigation and good
  > drainage, which is difficult in some areas, especially the delta
  > regions.

#### 3.1.4 Constraints to SRI Adoption {#constraints-to-sri-adoption}

Despite its clear benefits, the large-scale adoption of SRI faces
several practical challenges on the ground ^6^:

- **Strict Water Control:** Requires reliable irrigation and good
  > drainage, which is difficult in some areas, especially the delta
  > regions. - **Labor and Skill:** Initially requires more skilled labor for careful
  > transplanting of young, single seedlings. - **Weed Menace:** The non-flooded conditions can lead to higher weed
  > pressure if mechanical weeding is not timely and effective. - **Farmer Mindset:** Overcoming the traditional belief that more
  > seedlings and continuous water are necessary for a good crop is a
  > significant barrier. - **Implement Availability:** Lack of access to critical implements like
  > markers and cono weeders can hinder adoption. The extensive and detailed promotion of SRI, complete with robust
economic data and an honest assessment of its constraints, indicates a
major institutional strategy by TNAU. It is a clear effort to
re-engineer the state\'s rice production system towards greater
sustainability and resilience in the face of modern agricultural
challenges.

for other cultivation systems suited to different water availability
scenarios. #### 3.2.1 Transplanted Puddled Lowland Rice (Conventional Wet System) {#transplanted-puddled-lowland-rice-conventional-wet-system}

This is the traditional irrigated method. Key practices include ^6^:

- **Nursery Management:** Using a wet or dry nursery with a seed rate of
  > 30-60 kg/ha depending on variety duration. - **Main Field Preparation:** Extensive puddling of the field with 2.5
  > cm of standing water to create a soft, impervious layer. - **Manuring:** Application of 12.5 t/ha of FYM or 6.25 t/ha of green
  > leaf manure, along with biofertilizers like *Azospirillum*. - **Transplanting:** Planting 2-3 seedlings per hill at an age of 18-40

#### 3.2.2 Dry Seeded Rainfed Systems (Dry System) {#dry-seeded-rainfed-systems-dry-system}

These systems are used in areas without assured irrigation, relying
solely on monsoon rains. - **Dry Seeded Rainfed Un-puddled Low Land:** Involves dry ploughing to
  > achieve a fine tilth, sowing dry seeds (75 kg/ha) with the onset of
  > monsoon, and managing weeds through manual or chemical methods.^6^

- **Rainfed Upland Rice:** Practiced on sloping lands, success is highly
  > dependent on rainfall distribution. It requires fine tilth for good
  > germination, using short-duration varieties and a seed rate of
  > 80-100 kg/ha.^6^

#### 3.2.3 Semidry System {#semidry-system}

This is an intermediate system where the crop is direct-sown under dry
conditions like a rainfed crop, but is converted to a wet, irrigated
system once canal or tank water becomes available, typically after 30-45
days. This system is common in command areas where water release is
delayed.^6^

chunksize 25
section: Section 4: Nursery and Crop Establishment Practices
subsection: null
The foundation of a healthy and productive paddy crop is laid in the
nursery. TNAU\'s recommendations emphasize a proactive and integrated
approach to nursery management, focusing on producing vigorous,
disease-free seedlings that are well-prepared for transplanting into the
main field. This strategy aims to build resilience into the crop from
its earliest stage, thereby reducing the need for curative interventions
later in its lifecycle.

chunksize 26
section: Section 4: Nursery and Crop Establishment Practices
subsection: 4.1 Types of Nursery Management {#types-of-nursery-management}
Three primary types of nurseries are recommended, each suited to
different water availability situations and cultivation systems.^7^

- **Wet Nursery:** This is the conventional method used for transplanted
  > puddled rice. It requires a 20-cent (800 m²) area near a reliable
  > water source to raise seedlings for one hectare. The preparation
  > involves dry ploughing, application of FYM, and repeated puddling. A
  > basal dose of 40 kg DAP is recommended for less fertile soils. > Sprouted seeds are sown uniformly on leveled beds with a thin film
  > of water.^7^

- **Dapog / Mat Nursery:** This modern method is essential for SRI and
  > mechanical transplanting. Seedlings are raised on a firm surface
  > (like a polythene sheet or concrete floor) in a thin layer of a
  > specially prepared soil mixture. The required area is only 100 m²
  > per hectare. The soil mix typically consists of 70% soil, 20%
  > well-decomposed organic matter (FYM/pressmud), and 10% rice hull,
  > enriched with fertilizer. Seedlings are ready for transplanting in
  > just 14-20 days.^7^

- **Dry Nursery:** This method is adopted when there is a delay in the
  > receipt of canal water or when water is scarce.

chunksize 28
section: Section 4: Nursery and Crop Establishment Practices
subsection: 4.2 Seed Quality, Rates, and Pre-Sowing Treatments {#seed-quality-rates-and-pre-sowing-treatments}
The quality of the seed is a non-negotiable prerequisite for a good
crop. TNAU provides specific guidelines for seed selection, rates, and
protective treatments. - **Seed Rates:** The recommended seed rate varies significantly with
  > the cultivation method ^7^:

  - **SRI Method:** 7-8 kg/ha

  - **Conventional Method:** 30 kg/ha (long duration), 40 kg/ha (medium
    > duration), 60 kg/ha (short duration), 20 kg/ha (hybrids). - **Seed Quality Upgradation:** A simple and effective method to ensure
  > the use of viable seeds is to immerse them in a common salt
  > solution. A solution is prepared by dissolving salt in water until a
  > fresh egg floats. When seeds are added, the low-density, non-viable
  > seeds float and can be skimmed off. The healthy, sunken seeds are
  > then washed thoroughly before use.^7^

- **Seed Treatment:** Pre-sowing seed treatment is a critical step to
  > protect the seedlings from seed-borne diseases and provide an
  > initial growth boost.

- **Seed Treatment:** Pre-sowing seed treatment is a critical step to
  > protect the seedlings from seed-borne diseases and provide an

    > provides protection against diseases like blast for up to 40
    > days.^4^

  - **Biological Treatment with *Pseudomonas fluorescens*:** Seeds are
    > treated with a talc-based formulation of this beneficial bacterium
    > (10 g/kg of seed) and soaked overnight. This provides protection
    > against several fungal and bacterial diseases.^4^

  - **Biofertilizer Treatment with *Azospirillum*:** Seeds are soaked in
    > a slurry of bio-inoculants like *Azospirillum* (a nitrogen-fixing
    > bacterium) and *Phosphobacteria* (a phosphate-solubilizing
    > bacterium) or a combined formulation like *Azophos*. This helps in

chunksize 31
section: Section 4: Nursery and Crop Establishment Practices
subsection: 4.3 Main Field Preparation and Transplanting {#main-field-preparation-and-transplanting}
Proper establishment in the main field is the final step in ensuring a
healthy crop stand. - **Land Preparation:** The main field is prepared by summer ploughing
  > to conserve moisture and reduce initial weed load. For wet
  > cultivation, the field is flooded and then puddled multiple times to
  > create a soft, impermeable soil layer that holds water and
  > facilitates easy transplanting.^4^

- **Transplanting:** This is a delicate operation with long-term
  > consequences for the crop\'s performance. Key recommendations
  > include ^4^:

  - **Optimum Seedling Age:** Varies by duration: 18-22 days for short,
    > 25-30 for medium, and 35-40 for long duration varieties. - **Number of Seedlings:** 2-3 seedlings per hill for short duration
    > and 2 per hill for medium/long duration varieties. - **Planting Depth:** Shallow planting (3 cm) is strongly recommended
    > as it encourages quicker establishment and profuse tillering. > Deeper planting (\>5 cm) can delay establishment and reduce the
    > number of tillers. - **Spacing:** Specific spacing recommendations are provided based on
    > soil fertility and crop duration, ranging from 15x10 cm in less
    > fertile soils for short-duration crops to 20x20 cm in high
    > fertility soils for long-duration crops.^4^

subsection: null
Nutrient management in paddy cultivation has evolved from a reliance on
high doses of chemical fertilizers to a more scientific, precise, and
sustainable Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) approach. This system,
advocated by TNAU, combines the use of organic manures, biofertilizers,
and chemical fertilizers in a balanced and efficient manner. The goal is
to sustain long-term soil health and productivity while optimizing
economic returns and minimizing environmental impact.

chunksize 33
section: Section 5: Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)
subsection: 5.1 Role of Nutrients and Deficiency Symptoms {#role-of-nutrients-and-deficiency-symptoms}
Understanding the function of essential nutrients and recognizing their
deficiency symptoms is crucial for timely corrective action. - **Macronutrients:**

  - **Nitrogen (N):** Universally the most limiting nutrient for rice
    > productivity. It is vital for vegetative development, imparting a
    > healthy green color to leaves and promoting tillering. The plant
    > primarily takes up nitrogen in the form of ammonia in submerged
    > soils.^8^

  - **Phosphorus (P):** Particularly important in early growth stages. > It promotes root development, tillering, and early flowering. It
    > is mobile within the plant and can be remobilized from older
    > tissues to new growth areas.^8^

  - **Potassium (K):** Deficiency symptoms include dark green plants
    > with yellowish-brown leaf margins and necrotic spots on the tips
    > of older leaves. It can also lead to weak stems and lodging.^8^

- **Secondary and Micronutrients:**

  - **Silica (Si):** Essential for paddy, increasing the strength and
    > rigidity of cells, which helps in resisting lodging and pest
    > attacks.^8^

  - **Iron (Fe):** Necessary for chlorophyll synthesis.

  - **Iron (Fe):** Necessary for chlorophyll synthesis. Toxicity can be
    > an issue, causing leaves to become short, brittle, and
    > bleached.^8^

  - **Zinc (Zn):** Deficiency leads to dusty brown spots on upper
    > leaves, stunted growth, and decreased tillering.^8^

  - **Boron (B):** Deficiency is characterized by white or bleached,
    > rolled, and curled tips of the youngest leaves, leading to
    > stunting and death of growing points.^8^

chunksize 35
section: Section 5: Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)
subsection: 5.2 Fertilizer Recommendations and Application Schedules {#fertilizer-recommendations-and-application-schedules}
TNAU provides specific \"blanket recommendations\" for NPK application,
tailored to the different rice ecosystems practiced in Tamil Nadu. These
serve as a baseline, which should ideally be adjusted based on soil test
results. - Blanket N:P:K Recommendations (Kg/ha) ^8^:

  - **Transplanted Puddled Low Land Rice:** 150:50:50

  - **Direct Wet Seeded / Rainfed Rice:** 50:25:25

  - **Semidry System:** 75:25:37.5

- Application Methods and Schedule ^8^:

  - **Basal Application:** The entire recommended dose of Phosphorus (P)
    > and 25% of the recommended Nitrogen (N) and Potassium (K) are
    > applied at the time of the last puddling and incorporated into the
    > soil. Micronutrients like Zinc Sulphate (25 kg/ha) are also
    > applied basally. - **Top Dressing:** The remaining 75% of N and K is applied in three
    > equal splits at critical growth stages: active tillering, panicle
    > initiation, and heading. This split application ensures that
    > nutrients are available to the plant when they are most needed,
    > improving nutrient use efficiency and preventing losses. - **Precision Nitrogen Management:** To move beyond calendar-based
  > application, the use of a **Leaf Colour Chart (LCC)** is
  > recommended.

chunksize 37
section: Section 5: Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)
subsection: 5.3 Organic Manures and Biofertilizers {#organic-manures-and-biofertilizers}
The integration of organic and biological nutrient sources is a
cornerstone of the INM philosophy, aimed at improving soil health and
structure, which cannot be achieved by chemical fertilizers alone. - **Organic Manures:** The application of 12.5 tonnes/ha of Farmyard
  > Manure (FYM) or compost, or 6.25 tonnes/ha of green manure (like
  > *Sesbania* or *Daincha*), is recommended. These are incorporated
  > into the soil during land preparation.^4^

- **Biofertilizers:** These are microbial inoculants that enhance
  > nutrient availability to the plant. Key biofertilizers for rice
  > include ^8^:

  - **Nitrogen Fixers:**

    - ***Azospirillum*:** A bacterium that fixes atmospheric nitrogen. > It can be applied as a seed treatment, soil application, or
      > through a seedling root dip before transplanting. - ***Azolla*:** A free-floating water fern that harbors a
      > nitrogen-fixing blue-green alga. It can be incorporated as a
      > green manure before transplanting or grown as a dual crop along
      > with rice, where it suppresses weeds and continuously provides
      > nitrogen. - **Blue Green Algae (BGA):** Applied to the flooded field (10
      > kg/ha) about 10 days after transplanting.

      > zinc and copper from the soil.^8^

This integrated approach, combining the precision of tools like the LCC
with the soil-building properties of organic manures and the
nutrient-enhancing capabilities of biofertilizers, represents a
sophisticated strategy to sustain rice productivity for the long term.

Yield losses in rice due to insect pests can be as high as 22%, making
effective crop protection an indispensable component of successful
cultivation.^9^ The approach advocated by TNAU is a mature Integrated
Pest Management (IPM) system that systematically prioritizes cultural

Historical disease epidemics, such as the Blast epidemic in Thanjavur
(1919) and the Rice Tungro outbreak in Tamil Nadu (1985-87), underscore
the devastating potential of pathogens.^14^ TNAU provides detailed
diagnostic and management guides for these critical diseases. - **Blast (*Pyricularia oryzae*):** This is arguably the most
  > significant fungal disease of rice. It manifests as **Leaf Blast**
  > (spindle-shaped lesions), **Nodal Blast** (blackening and breaking
  > of nodes), and **Neck Blast** (girdling of the panicle base, causing

This catalog of implements demonstrates a clear strategy to build a
complete technological \"package\" for farmers. The development of
specialized tools for SRI, coupled with government schemes that provide
subsidies for these very implements, creates a powerful incentive
structure that nudges the entire paddy cultivation system towards
modernization, higher efficiency, and greater profitability.

chunksize 51
section: Section 8: Post-Harvest Technology and Value Addition
subsection: null
The journey of paddy does not end at the farm gate. Post-harvest
management is a critical phase that determines the final quality, market
value, and economic return from the crop. The TNAU portal provides
extensive information on the entire post-harvest chain, from primary
processing to storage and value addition. This focus extends beyond mere
cultivation, promoting a market-oriented approach where farmers and
entrepreneurs can capture greater value from the entire supply chain.

chunksize 52
section: Section 8: Post-Harvest Technology and Value Addition
subsection: 8.1 Primary Processing: From Harvest to Milling {#primary-processing-from-harvest-to-milling}
Each step in the primary processing chain must be executed with care to
maximize grain yield and minimize quality deterioration. - **Harvesting:** The timing of the harvest is crucial. The optimal
  > stage is when about 80% of the panicles have 80% ripened spikelets,
  > and the grain moisture content is around 20%. Harvesting can be done
  > manually with sickles or mechanically using reapers or combine
  > harvesters.^16^

- **Threshing and Drying:** Threshing, the separation of grain from the
  > straw, should be done immediately after harvesting to prevent
  > quality loss. This can be done manually by beating the stalks or
  > mechanically with threshers. The freshly threshed paddy must then be
  > dried to a safe moisture level for storage. Methods include
  > traditional **sun drying**, more reliable **mechanical drying** with
  > heated air, and **chemical drying** by spraying a salt solution on
  > the standing crop to hasten moisture reduction.^16^

- **Parboiling:** This is a pre-milling hydrothermal treatment where
  > rough rice is soaked, steamed, and then dried.

  > the standing crop to hasten moisture reduction.^16^

- **Parboiling:** This is a pre-milling hydrothermal treatment where
  > rough rice is soaked, steamed, and then dried. Parboiling improves
  > the milling quality (leading to higher head rice recovery), enhances
  > the nutritive value by driving B-vitamins from the bran into the
  > endosperm, and improves the storability of the rice.^16^

- **Milling:** Milling is the process that transforms rough rice (paddy)
  > into edible rice. The process involves ^16^:

  1. **Cleaning:** Removing foreign matter like stones, dust, and
      > chaff. 2. **Hulling (De-husking):** Removing the outer hull to produce brown
      > rice. 3. **Polishing (Bran Removal):** Abrading the bran layers from the
      > brown rice to produce white rice. The degree of polishing
      > affects the appearance and nutritional content of the final
      > product.

chunksize 54
section: Section 8: Post-Harvest Technology and Value Addition
subsection: 8.2 Storage and Quality Grading {#storage-and-quality-grading}
- **Storage:** Proper storage is essential to protect the grain from
  > weather and pests. Grains can be stored in bags or in bulk. The
  > basic requirements for good storage are a healthy, clean, and
  > uniformly dried grain, and a storage structure that maintains a
  > suitable environment and prevents pest infestation.^16^

- **Quality and Grading:** The quality of milled rice is assessed based
  > on characteristics like moisture content, percentage of broken
  > grains, presence of foreign matter, chalkiness, and whiteness. Based
  > on these parameters, Indian rice is graded into three main
  > categories: **Common** (short/long bold), **Fine** (medium slender),
  > and **Superfine** (long/short slender).^16^

subsection: 8.3 By-Products and Value-Added Rice Products {#by-products-and-value-added-rice-products}
A \"whole crop\" utilization approach can significantly increase the
profitability of rice cultivation. Modern milling yields valuable
by-products, and rice itself is the base for numerous value-added
products. - By-Products ^16^:

  - **Rice Husk:** An abundant source of biomass fuel for boilers and
    > kilns. The ash, being rich in silica, is used as an abrasive. - **Rice Straw:** Used as livestock fodder, for mushroom cultivation,
    > and as a raw material for papermaking. - **Rice Bran:** The most valuable by-product. It is used as a
    > high-quality animal feed and is the source of **Rice Bran Oil**, a
    > healthy cooking oil rich in antioxidants like oryzanol and
    > tocotrienols. - Value-Added Products ^16^:

  - **Processed Products:** These are traditional convenience foods like
    > **parched rice**, **puffed rice (*pori*)**, and **flaked rice**,
    > which are produced through various heating and flattening
    > processes. - **Fermented Products:** Rice is a key ingredient in iconic South
    > Indian fermented foods like ***idli*** (steamed rice cake) and
    > ***dosa*** (savory crepe), which are made from a fermented batter
    > of rice and black gram.
